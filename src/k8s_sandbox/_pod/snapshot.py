"""Fast, low-overhead reads of Kubernetes Pod state.

The kubernetes Python client deserializes every API response into its generated
model classes (``V1Pod`` et al.) via ``ApiClient.__deserialize``. That code path
is slow and effectively single-threaded, so it becomes a serialization
bottleneck under high concurrency. In particular the frequently-called pod
restart check (``check_for_pod_restart``) starts timing out and grinds large,
many-cluster evals to a halt.
See https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/2284.

We sidestep the model layer by requesting the raw response
(``_preload_content=False``) and parsing only the handful of fields we actually
use out of the JSON ourselves. ``PodSnapshot`` is that minimal, immutable view.

Note: the kubernetes client still raises ``ApiException`` for non-2xx responses
even with ``_preload_content=False`` (the status check runs before the response
is returned), so error handling at call sites is unchanged. The raw JSON uses
camelCase keys (``containerStatuses``, ``restartCount``, ...), unlike the
snake_case attributes on the generated model classes.
