    """Summarise the state of a Helm release's pods for inclusion in error messages.

    Reads container states, termination reasons and exit codes from the Kubernetes API
    so that failures which Helm reports only generically (e.g. "Pod is in the Pending
    phase" or "Containers in CrashLoop state") can be attributed to a concrete cause
    such as ImagePullBackOff or OOMKilled.

    This is best-effort: it is intended to be called from error-handling paths, so any
    failure while gathering diagnostics is swallowed and results in None rather than
    masking the original error.

    Args:
        context_name: The kubeconfig context name, or None for the current context.
        namespace: The namespace the release was installed into.
        release_name: The Helm release name (used to select its pods).
        object_names: Names of the release's other objects, whose Warning events are
            reported too. A controller which cannot create its pod at all (a missing
            RuntimeClass, say) is only explained by the event on the controller.
